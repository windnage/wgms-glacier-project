    "# Explode Glacier Polygons\n",

    "This notebook explodes (merges) all glacier polygons that are touching to turn them into one polygon. Glaciers that are touching are part of a glacier catchment and I am interested in catchements as well as individual glaciers. Not all regions contain ice caps. The regions that have ice caps and that are processed in this notebook are the following:\n",

    "* Region 8 - Scandinavia\n",
    "* Region 9 - Russian Arctic\n",
    "* Region 10 - Asia, North\n",
    "* Region 17 - Southern Andes\n",

    "The ice cap and icefield outlines were created by looking at the GLIMS Viewer map (http://www.glims.org/maps/glims) and manaully selecting lat/lon bounding box coordinates around the ice caps.\n",

    "Adding region 16 (low latitudes) as a region to do ice cap analysis because South America has some small ice caps, but this was not initially identified as a region that needed ice cap analysis.\n",
